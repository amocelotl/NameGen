Javascript Based Name Generator for DnD NPCs

DnD NPC Name Generator

Simple Javascript based name generator for NPCs.
Generates names for the following races:

- Human
- Elf
- Dwarf

Names for the races are stored in the following arrays

HUMANS - humanNames.js
DWARVES - dwarfNames.js
ELVES - elfNames.js


NOTES

DWARVES - surnames are compounded by combining two arrays


FURTHER WORK

Integrate properly into JQuery to support names fading in and out on button press.


HUMANS - add middle names
ELVES - tidy up formatting
DWARVES - add cognimens ("The Brash") on rare occaisons
